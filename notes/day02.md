# 📖 Day 2 – Professor Messer Practice Exam Drills & Consistency Tracking  

**Date:** Nov 10, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered  
- Completed **65 questions** directly from Professor Messer’s *Practice_Exams.pdf*  
- Covered a mix of **Threats, Network Security, Access Control, Cryptography, and Risk Management**  
- Achieved an **average accuracy of ~85%**, including **four perfect rounds (5/5)**  
- Practiced **10-question mixed exam simulation** to mimic real testing conditions  

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways  
- Accuracy and recall are improving — especially in **access control models, attack identification, and control types.**  
- Getting consistent 80%+ across multiple random pulls shows strong **content retention and applied reasoning.**  
- Noticed minor gaps in **MTTR vs RTO**, **Federation vs SSO**, and **SQL Injection variations**, which will be the next focus areas.  
- Regular GitHub logging helps reinforce accountability and builds a visible **study streak**.

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today proved that repetition with real CompTIA-style wording locks in both **pattern recognition** and **test logic.**  
I’m starting to think like the exam — reading carefully, spotting distractors, and trusting the reasoning process more confidently.  

**Action Plan for Tomorrow:**  
- Attempt a **20-question timed simulation** (Exam D advanced set)  
- Review any missed areas from today’s rounds  
- Continue building question variety to avoid repetition and maintain challenge level
