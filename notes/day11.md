### 🧩 What I Worked On Today
Today I focused on **targeted skill sharpening** instead of running the full Exam C.  
The goal was to eliminate every remaining weak area from Exam A and Exam B — and I made massive progress.

I completed:

- Multiple **5-question mixed weak-spot sets**  
- Several **3-question micro-drills**  
- A full **40-question Final Boss exam** built from all my previous mistakes  
- Additional randomized questions for reinforcement  

All targeting areas such as:
- CASB vs DLP vs IAM  
- MAC vs RBAC vs ABAC  
- Federation vs SSO vs OIDC vs SAML  
- NetFlow vs DNS logs vs PCAP  
- Tokenization vs Masking vs TDE  
- Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Cloud storage misconfigurations (ACLs)  
- OCSP stapling vs CRL  
- 802.1X Root CA trust errors  
- Incident response phases  
- Air gapping vs segmentation  
- Rootkits vs RATs
