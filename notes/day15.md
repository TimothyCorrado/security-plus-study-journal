# 📖 Day 15 – Final Exam Readiness & Master-Level Drills

**Date:** Nov 24, 2025

---

### 🧩 What I Worked On Today
Today was a full-scale **final readiness day** for the Security+ exam.  
I focused entirely on **CompTIA-accurate logic**, **high-difficulty question drills**, and **correcting every last weak spot**.

Completed:

- **50+ random questions** directly from my PDF (A/B/C exams)
- **CompTIA-aligned explanations** for every choice
- **Corrected mismatched PDF logic vs actual exam logic**
- **Deep review of Zero Trust, Crypto, CASB, Cloud, IAM, ACL models**
- **Master Cheat Sheet** created for full exam coverage
- Confidence check: confirmed I’m at consistently passing-level performance

### 💡 Key Takeaways & Improvements
- I now understand **why** CompTIA chooses its correct answers (not just *what* they are).
- Much stronger on:
  - Zero Trust vs MAC  
  - Tokenization vs masking vs hashing  
  - CASB vs DLP vs IAM  
  - Federation vs SSO vs OIDC vs OAuth  
  - OCSP vs CRL vs stapling  
  - RTO vs RPO  
  - Data roles (controller, processor, owner, custodian)  
  - Network attacks (domain hijack, DNS poisoning, on-path)
- Improved accuracy: **Consistently scoring around 80–90%** on mixed exam-level questions.
- Eliminated interpretation mistakes and aligned 100% to **CompTIA logic** instead of PDF inconsistencies.
- Feeling confident, calm, and sharp going into exam day.

### 🧠 Reflection
Today felt like the **final form** of all my studying.  
I worked through dozens of questions, corrected every lingering mistake, and built a solid understanding of:

- What CompTIA *actually* expects  
- How to eliminate distractors  
- How to choose the MOST secure / MOST complete / MOST CompTIA-preferred answer  

I’m not guessing anymore.  
I’m recognizing patterns instantly.  
I’m understanding the *reasoning* behind every correct answer.

After all the grinding, drilling, and correcting — I feel fully ready.

Tomorrow is exam day.  
I know I’ve earned it.
