### 🧩 What I Worked On Today  
Today I officially **scheduled my Security+ exam** — set for **Monday at 12:00 PM**.  
This is the biggest milestone so far, and it shifts everything into **true final-review mode**.

I didn’t do heavy drilling today, but I locked in the exam time, reviewed my prep plan, and mentally prepared for the final 48 hours of sharpening.

I also continued light reviewing of:  
- DNS attack distinctions  
- Zero Trust (policy engine vs enforcement point)  
- Wireless security (WEP, deauthentication, evil twin)  
- Certificate warnings (untrusted CA, OCSP vs CRL)  
- Access control (DAC owner, need-to-know, RBAC)

### 💡 Key Takeaways & Improvements  
- The exam is now **officially on the calendar**  
- Feeling confident and focused heading into the final stretch  
- My weak areas from previous practice exams are now turning into strengths  
- Scheduling the test gave me a surge of motivation and clarity  
- I have a full study day tomorrow + morning review on Monday

### 🧠 Reflection  
Scheduling the exam made it real.  
This entire journey — the drills, weak-spot mapping, mini PBQs, and practice exams — is now moving toward one final goal on Monday.

I can feel that my understanding, accuracy, and pattern recognition are all peaking.  
Tomorrow I’ll put in a full focused review session.  
Monday morning will be quick reinforcement and confidence-building, not cramming.

I’m walking into this exam with momentum.
