**Date:** Nov 14, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered
- Completed a **high-volume study session** using:
  - 5-question weak-area drills  
  - 10-question mixed-domain review  
  - Cloud-model micro-drills  
  - Attack-chain and governance micro-drills  
  - An 8-question cleanup drill targeting missed concepts  
  - A **fresh 30-question full Security+ simulation**  
  - A **30-question randomized set** pulled directly from Professor Messer’s *Practice_Exams.pdf* (Exam A, B, and C)
- Covered every major Security+ domain:
  - Cloud, IAM, risk, governance  
  - CASB vs SWG  
  - Backup types and incident response flow  
  - Attack chain stages  
  - Email security (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)  
  - Network security and segmentation  
  - Threat actors and attack types

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Today was a massive practice day with a total of **108 questions completed** from a mix of:
  - Real Professor Messer practice exam questions  
  - CompTIA-style simulation questions  
  - Weak-area reinforcement drills  
- Strong performance across:
  - CASB vs SWG  
  - Cloud models (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS / FaaS)  
  - Attack chain sequencing  
  - CMK vs provider-managed keys  
  - Differential vs incremental backups  
  - Privilege management (PAM, RBAC, etc.)  
- Identified small but consistent weak spots:
  - **SPF vs DKIM vs DMARC**  
  - **Forward proxy vs IPsec**  
  - **Operational vs administrative controls**  
  - **WPA3 vs MAC filtering**  
  - **Pharming vs ARP poisoning**  
- These are minor conceptual areas and highly fixable with targeted drills.

### 🧠 Reflection
This was one of my highest-output study days yet.  
Working through both **Professor Messer’s official practice questions** and **CompTIA-style simulations** helped reveal how different sources emphasize different nuances.

It reinforced:
- Terminology precision  
- Email and DNS security fundamentals  
- Cloud architecture distinctions  
- Exact IR sequencing (contain → eradicate → recover → lessons learned)  
- The type of “small detail” questions that often appear on the real Security+ exam

My performance trajectory continues upward, and I can feel myself internalizing the reasoning patterns needed to pass.

### 🎯 Action Plan for Tomorrow
- Focused 10–20 question drill on **SPF/DKIM/DMARC**, proxies, wireless security (WPA3), and the other concepts missed today  
- Another randomized **20–30 question set from Professor Messer’s PDF**  
- PBQ-focused session (firewall rules, cloud architectures, attack chain mapping)  
- Continue building consistency and tracking progress in GitHub
