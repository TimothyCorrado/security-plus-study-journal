# 📖 Day 3 – Attack Chain Focus & Advanced Security+ Simulations  

**Date:** Nov 11, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered  
- Completed **50 new practice questions** from Professor Messer’s *Practice_Exams.pdf*  
- Focused on **attack chain stages** (delivery, exploitation, persistence, exfiltration) and **governance/compliance** concepts  
- Ran multiple **10-question advanced simulations** from Exam D section  
- Average performance: **~75% overall accuracy**, with strengths in **governance, risk, and control types**  

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways  
- Much stronger in **compliance frameworks, due care vs due diligence**, and **risk management strategies**  
- Discovered that **attack-chain stage recognition** (especially *persistence* vs *exploitation*) needs more repetition  
- Accuracy remains **consistently 70–85%**, showing exam-ready comprehension across most domains  
- Learned that CompTIA’s “most correct” logic is about **sequence and context**, not just identifying the right concept

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today was all about fine-tuning understanding, not just answering correctly.  
I’m starting to **see the flow of an attack** — from reconnaissance to exfiltration — and how it ties into governance, risk, and compliance decisions.  
Even the missed questions helped reinforce sequencing and terminology under exam pressure.  

**Action Plan for Tomorrow:**  
- Do a **5-question micro-drill** on attack chain sequencing to lock in persistence/exploitation  
- Follow with a **20-question mixed-domain simulation** to test endurance and pacing  
- Keep tracking improvement in GitHub for visible growth over time
