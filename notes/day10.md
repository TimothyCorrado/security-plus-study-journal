# 📖 Day 10 – Full Practice Exam B + Pattern Mastery

**Date:** Nov 18, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered
Today I completed **Professor Messer’s Practice Exam B** and performed a full, detailed review of every question I missed. This included:
- **24 missed questions** across diverse Security+ domains
- Deep-dive explanations for each incorrect answer
- Pattern-recognition breakdowns based on CompTIA’s phrasing
- Identification of recurring weak spots
- Creation of keyword triggers to reinforce exam-style recognition

Topics reviewed included:
- **Incident response order & evidence handling** (IR phases, chain of custody)
- **Data states** (in-transit, at-rest, in-use)
- **Network attacks** (SYN flood, smurf, DNS tunneling)
- **Email security** (DKIM, SPF, DMARC)
- **Web app security** (WAF, IDOR, broken access control)
- **Cloud concepts** (sovereignty, autoscaling, OCSP stapling)
- **Wireless security** (WPA3, 802.1X certificate validation)
- **Crypto** (symmetric keys, TPM, secure enclave)
- **IAM and roles** (data subject, controller, separation of duties)
- **Network segmentation & ACLs**
- **Logging** (NetFlow for lateral movement)
- **Virtualization & isolation** (air gaps, secure enclaves)

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Strengthened key distinctions that CompTIA loves to trick test takers with:
  - **IDOR vs Broken Access Control**
  - **Tokenization vs Masking vs TDE**
  - **Rootkit vs RAT vs Spyware**
  - **Botnet scanning vs beaconing vs SYN flood**
  - **OCSP stapling vs CRL checks**
  - **Separation of duties vs key rotation**
- Clarified that:
  - **WAF** is the best defense against SQLi & malformed HTTP traffic.
  - **Chain of custody** guarantees admissible evidence handling.
  - **NetFlow** is the correct choice for detecting lateral movement.
  - **TPM** provides hardware-backed keys and anti-bruteforce protections.
  - **Secure enclaves** support true RNG and encrypted app memory.
  - **Data sovereignty** controls which country data must stay in.
  - **Symmetric encryption** uses the same key for encrypt/decrypt.
  - **ARO** = how many times per year an event occurs.

### 🧠 Reflection
Exam B was significantly tougher than Exam A and exposed deeper conceptual weaknesses. Reviewing each missed question in detail helped solidify:
- My understanding of **CompTIA language patterns**
- How to differentiate between multiple valid-sounding options
- How to look for the **one specific keyword** CompTIA expects

This review was the most valuable study session yet. I now understand *why* I missed each question — not just what the right answer is.

I’m noticing faster pattern recognition, especially in:
- Cloud identity & certificate validation
- Mobile & wireless authentication
- Application attacks and misconfigurations
- Logging and network movement analysis

This session built the confidence needed for the final stretch toward test readiness.
