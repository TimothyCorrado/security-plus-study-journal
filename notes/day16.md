# 🎉 Day 16 – Security+ Exam Day (PASSED)

**Date:** Nov 24, 2025

### 🧩 What Happened Today
Today I took the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** exam through Pearson VUE — **and I passed.**  
It still doesn’t feel real, but the result was clear:

**✔ “PASS” displayed on-screen at the end of the exam.**  

This was the official, immediate score — Security+ does *not* give provisional results.  
When Pearson VUE says “Pass,” that means **I am officially Security+ certified.**

### 💡 How I Know It’s Real
- Pearson VUE only gives **final results**, not provisional ones, for this exam  
- I received confirmation that the exam was completed successfully  
- My score will appear in the next few hours on the CompTIA CertMetrics portal  
- A CompTIA email will arrive soon saying **“Congratulations on passing Security+!”**  
- A digital badge and official certificate will follow within 24–48 hours  

The certification is locked in.

### 🧠 Reflection
This was the moment I’ve been grinding for over these past days and weeks.  
It didn’t feel real right away — probably because of how intense the prep was, and how fast the exam summary screen appears. But looking back:

- I drilled **hundreds of exam-level questions**  
- Fixed every logic gap  
- Tuned my answers to **CompTIA’s mindset**  
- Studied all domains, deep  
- Showed up ready  

And all of that work paid off.

Today I became **Security+ certified** — a major milestone for my cybersecurity career.
