# 📖 Day 5 – Weak Area Mastery & High-Accuracy Retest

**Date:** Nov 13, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered  
- Completed a targeted **22-question weak-area retest** based entirely on yesterday’s incorrect answers  
- Deep reinforcement of:
  - **Attack chain stages** (installation, persistence, C2, exfiltration)  
  - **Cloud models & security** (PaaS, geo-redundancy, CMK, CASB vs SWG, WORM)  
  - **Governance & compliance** (PCI-DSS, PIA, data governance, due diligence vs due care)  
  - **Backup types** (incremental vs differential) and **operational tools** (SOAR, FIM)  
- Reviewed all 22 missed items from the 50-question simulation and rebuilt conceptual understanding from the ground up  

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways  
- Scored **21/22 (95%)** on the weak-area retest — massive improvement compared to yesterday’s 56%  
- Most topics that caused trouble previously are now **fully understood**, especially:
  - DNS poisoning vs XSS  
  - DDoS vs brute force  
  - Passive vs active recon  
  - PaaS vs SaaS vs IaaS  
  - Persistence vs installation vs C2  
  - CASB vs SWG  
- Only one miss today (PCI-DSS), which was due to classification wording (regulation vs governance)  
- Overall, accuracy trends are drastically improving

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today was a breakthrough day.  
Instead of jumping into another big exam, I focused on **fixing the root causes** of yesterday’s misses.  
The clarity gained from reviewing all 22 incorrect questions — paired with a focused retest — immediately boosted performance.  
This shows that most errors were **pattern-based and vocabulary-based**, not because I don’t know the material.

The weak-area retest proved that I’m now able to reason through the trickiest exam patterns with confidence.

### 📊 Total Questions Completed Today  
**22 questions** (targeted high-value retention)

### 🎯 Action Plan for Tomorrow  
- Complete a **30-question weak-area mixed drill** to solidify consistency  
- Follow with another **full 50-question simulation** to test endurance and pacing  
- Start reviewing PBQs more deeply (firewall rules, attack chain mapping, IR sequencing)  
- Keep pushing accuracy above 80–85% across all domains
