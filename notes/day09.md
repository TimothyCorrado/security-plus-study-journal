### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Converted every miss into a **clean keyword → concept** pattern.
- Built confidence identifying:
  - IAM and cloud governance triggers  
  - PKI data storage and integrity behaviors  
  - Wireless security controls  
  - Host-based protections vs network-based protections
- Repetition of patterns made it easier to quickly recognize what CompTIA is *really* asking.
- I’m now faster at distinguishing lookalikes like:
  - SPF vs DKIM vs DMARC  
  - Data owner vs data custodian  
  - COPE vs MDM  
  - Replay vs on-path

### 🧠 Reflection
Today was all about **reinforcing exam literacy**, not just memorizing facts.

I took the time to deeply analyze the structure of scenario questions, the common distractors, and the exact wording CompTIA uses to hint toward the correct answer. This kind of dedicated review builds long-term retention and helps eliminate repeated mistakes.

The cheat sheet is becoming more natural to recall, and the patterns feel a lot more automatic. This is the foundation for scoring even higher on the next practice exam.
