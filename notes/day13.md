**Date:** Nov 21, 2025

### 🧩 What I Worked On Today  
Today was a major milestone in my Security+ journey — I officially **purchased my Security+ exam voucher** and received the confirmation email. This locked in everything I’ve been building toward over the past couple of weeks.

Even though I didn’t schedule the exact exam date yet, I’m fully committed to getting it scheduled **tomorrow**. I’m entering full “final prep mode” now.

In addition:  
- Continued running **weak-spot drills** from Exam C  
- Practiced **5-question micro sets** between Lyft rides  
- Reviewed Zero Trust control plane components  
- Reinforced wireless security concepts (WEP, deauth, evil twin)  
- Strengthened DNS attack distinctions (poisoning vs hijacking vs pharming)  
- Revisited certificate errors and OCSP vs CRL  
- Improved recognition of DAC vs MAC vs RBAC vs ABAC  

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways & Improvements  
- My weak areas are shrinking fast — especially Zero Trust, DNS attacks, and certificate trust issues  
- I’m now consistently hitting **4/5 or 5/5** on targeted weak-spot drills  
- Concepts like **Jump servers, Policy engines, DAC file owners, and Eradication vs Containment** are becoming second nature  
- Wireless attack distinctions are now very clear (WEP = weakest, deauth vs jamming vs evil twin)  
- I’m feeling more confident knowing the exam voucher is purchased — the commitment is official

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today wasn’t heavy on volume, but it was heavy on **momentum** and **decision-making**.  

Buying the exam was a huge psychological step — it means I’m no longer “studying to someday take the test.”  
Now I’m studying to **pass a scheduled exam** within days.

My accuracy, focus, and consistency continue to rise.  
Tomorrow I’ll tighten up all remaining weak spots and schedule the official test date.

### 📊 Total Progress Today  
- **Exam voucher purchased**  
- **Multiple 5-question improvement sets**  
- **Zero Trust / certificate / DNS attack refreshers**  
- **Strong performance on weak-spot drills**

Estimated total: **20–30 minutes of targeted, high-value review**

### 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow  
- **Schedule the Security+ exam**  
- Run a **50-question weak-spot drill**  
- Start the **48-hour final review cycle**  
- PBQ warmups (logs, firewall rules, network diagrams)  
- Get accuracy stabilized above 85% before test day  

Tomorrow is the start of the final push.
