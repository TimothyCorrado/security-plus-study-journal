# 📖 Day 4 – Full Exam Simulation, Multiple Quizzes & Targeted Weak-Point Discovery

**Date:** Nov 12, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered  
- Completed a **full 50-question Security+ simulation exam**, designed to closely match CompTIA SY0-701 difficulty and structure  
- Completed multiple **short-form quizzes** throughout the day:
  - Several **5-question drills**  
  - Multiple **10-question mixed-domain simulations**  
  - A set of **PBQ-style questions** (firewall rules, control types, kill-chain ordering, CIA triad, risk strategies)  
- Practiced advanced scenario reasoning and “most correct answer” logic  
- Identified recurring patterns in incorrect answers and clear domains that need reinforcement  

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways  
- Clear weak areas emerged:
  - **Cloud models & architecture** (PaaS/IaaS/CMK), CASB vs SWG, WORM storage  
  - **Governance & compliance** (PCI-DSS, NIST frameworks, PIA, due care vs due diligence)  
  - **Attack chain stages** (installation, persistence, C2, exfiltration)  
  - **IR operations** (incremental vs differential, SOAR vs playbooks)  
- Strengths remained consistent in:
  - IAM fundamentals  
  - Control type identification  
  - Risk strategies and governance logic  
- Scored **56% (28/50)** on the simulation, revealing exactly which concepts to review next

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today’s mix of micro-drills, PBQs, and a full-length exam gave me a highly accurate snapshot of my current readiness.  
Even though the large simulation showed gaps, the smaller quizzes helped isolate the exact concepts I need to sharpen.  
This wasn’t a “pass-the-exam” day — it was a **diagnostic breakthrough day**, showing me where to focus for maximum improvement.

**Total Questions Completed Today:** **135**

This was my highest-volume study day so far, equivalent to multiple full exam attempts worth of practice.

**Action Plan for Tomorrow:**  
- Review all **22 missed questions** from the 50-question simulation  
- Complete a **30-question weak-area drill** (cloud, governance, attack chain, IR)  
- Follow with another **50-question simulation** to track improvement  
- Keep pushing short quizzes to strengthen pattern recognition under exam conditions
