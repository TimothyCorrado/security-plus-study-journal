# 📖 Day 12 – Practice Exam C Review & Targeted Weak-Spot Mapping  
**Date:** Nov 20, 2025  

---

### 🧩 What I Worked On Today  
Today I completed **Professor Messer’s Practice Exam C** from start to finish.  
Instead of just checking the score, I went deeper and performed a **full diagnostic breakdown** of every question I missed (PBQs + multiple choice).

I identified **every weak domain**, then mapped each incorrect question to:  
- The correct answer  
- The exam trap  
- The proper reasoning  
- A memory lock-in method  

Missed questions included:  
1, 2, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 39, 56, 59, 61, 67, 75, 80, 84, 88

This review helped me pinpoint higher-level topics such as:  
- Certificate usage and digital signing  
- DAC permissions (file owner role)  
- DNS poisoning vs pharming  
- OS hardening and patch management  
- Supply chain risks with IPsec tunnels  
- Zero Trust control plane components  
- WEP weaknesses and wireless security  
- Logging types (auth logs vs flow logs)  
- Managerial vs technical controls  
- Rootkits, Trojans, and stealth malware behavior  
- Risk acceptance vs mitigation  
- Air gapping vs VLAN vs firewall segmentation  
- Processor vs controller vs custodian (data roles)

### 💡 Key Takeaways & Improvements  
- I now have a **crystal clear map** of the exact topics I need to drill tomorrow  
- Many of the missed questions were **exam traps**, not knowledge gaps  
- Reinforced distinctions like:
  - OCSP vs CRL  
  - Wildcard certificates (`*.example.com`)  
  - “Need to know” vs “least privilege”  
  - Bcrypt = slow hashing + salting  
  - Community cloud vs public/private  
  - IPS false positives and alert tuning  
- Wireless attacks are now much sharper:
  - Deauthentication vs jamming  
  - DNS poisoning vs pharming  
  - WEP weakness patterns  
- Most incorrect answers were due to **question phrasing**, not lack of understanding  
- After reviewing each one, I now understand the **correct reasoning instantly**

### 🧠 Reflection  
Today was about **accuracy and clarity**, not speed.  
Practice Exam C revealed the deeper conceptual areas that can still trip me up — and now they’re fully mapped.

This was one of my most productive days because:

- Every mistake turned into a targeted lesson  
- Each wrong answer now has a “why” behind it  
- Several security models (DAC, Zero Trust, RTOS, IAM roles) are now **much clearer**  
- I feel more confident progressing to final review cycles tomorrow  

I ended the day knowing *exactly* what I need to drill next to hit consistent 85–90%+ accuracy.

### 📊 Total Questions Completed Today  
**90 questions** (Practice Exam C)  
**100 questions** (ChatGPT Strengthening weak area questions)  
**Score:** 68/90 → **75.5%**  

Estimated total: **190 questions**

### 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow  
- Run a **focused 50-question weak-spot drill**  
- Complete several **5-question rapid-fire sets**  
- Optional PBQ warmups  
- Begin **final 48-hour test-readiness cycle**  
- Continue pushing accuracy upward  
- Check scheduling window after confidence stabilizes  

Tomorrow will be about **turning every remaining weak spot into a strength**.
