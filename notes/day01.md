# 📖 Day 1 – Professor Messer Practice Exam Performance & Study Adjustment

**Date:** Nov 9, 2025  

---

### 🧩 Topics Covered
- Completed a **90-question Professor Messer practice exam**
- Scored **60%**, consistent with previous two attempts
- Reviewed **exam-style wording and difficulty differences** between Messer and ChatGPT question sets
- Began refining study method to focus on **CompTIA-style phrasing** and **scenario-based reasoning**

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Realized that ChatGPT-style quizzes were helpful for concept recall, but **not aligned with the wording** or “choose the most correct” logic used by CompTIA.  
- **Professor Messer exams** reflect the real exam more accurately — questions are longer, trickier, and test subtle differences between correct answers.  
- I’ve been averaging around **60%** across three full practice exams, showing **consistent understanding but room for deeper test-style conditioning.**  
- Uploaded Messer’s practice exam PDF into ChatGPT to **create targeted question drills** directly from those materials.

### 🧠 Reflection
Today helped me recognize that it’s not just about *knowing the content*, but about *learning how CompTIA phrases and layers questions.*  
My next step is to focus my practice on **realistic question patterns**, re-review incorrect answers, and track improvement using customized drills.

**Action Plan for Tomorrow:**
- Review all missed questions and explanations  
- Focus on risk management, framework, and crypto topics (common weak areas)  
- Aim for 70%+ on next practice exam
